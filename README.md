# Learning Coq

I'm mostly going through the [Software Foundations books](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), and probably doing a bit of other stuff as well.

The .v files are named to match the chapters in the books. (So far I've done a bunch of _Logical Foundations_ and nothing else.)

Run with

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/learn-coq -w /learn-coq coqorg/coq make
```

etc
